1. IO redirect:
	Three files for each program open in a shell: 0, Standard in; 1, Standard out; 2, Standard error
	Redirect stdin: some-command < /path/to/some/file
	Redirect stdout: some-command > /path/to/some/file
	Redirect stderr: some-command 2> /path/to/some/file
	<file	means open a file for reading and associate with stdin.
	<<token Means use the current input stream as stdin for the program until token is seen.
	>file	means open a file for writing and truncate it and associate it with stdout
	>>file means open a file for writing and seek to the end and associate it with stdout
	n>&m means redirect FD n to the same places as FD m. Eg, 2>&1 means send send stderr to the same place that stdout is goint to.

2. pipe: output_to_stdoutput_cmd | accept_stdin_input_command  
	Useful command: cut, sort, uniq, grep, less, more, tee, wc, tr, col, join, paste, expand, split, xargs...

3. if:
   if ...; then
      ... 
   elif ...; then
      ...
   else 
      ...
   fi
	[ -f "somefile" ] : return if somefile is a file
	[ -d "somedir" ] : return if somedir is a directory
	[ -x "/bin/ls" ] : return if /bin/ls exist and executable
	[ -n "$var" ] : return if the variable var set a value
	and -r, -w, -x check if the file readable, writable, executable.
	[ "$a" = "$b" ] : return if $a the same with $b
	NOTE: The blankspace after '[' and before ']' is must. And ' ' before after '=' is must.

	condition_expression && do_one_thing, means do one thing when the condition is true.
	condition_expression || do_one_thing, means do one thing when the condition is false.

5. $1, the first argument transferred to the script. For example: script 123.txt. $1 is 123.txt
   $*, all the arguments transferred to th escript.

6. '' and \ can be used to print reserved keyword.

7. function: 
   define a function: function afun(){echo $1;} 
   call the funciton: afun helloworld

8. get the result of a command: var=`command [option] [param]`
   date=`date +%Y%d%m`; echo $date

9. "#!" at the begining of the script, it indicates the sh environment this script needed.
   #! bin/bash, it indicates to run ~/.bashrc before run the script
